# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview

This analysis is designed to identify the number of retiring employees at the Pewlett Hackard company. We have broken the results into retirees per title, and we have also identified employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This analysis is to provide support to "Bobby's manager" as he makes decisions based around this large number of retirement aged employees.

# Results

-A large majority of all retirement eligible employees are Senior employees.
-There are only two managers in this pool. This may be the most important point.
-There are 1549 eligible candidates for the mentorship program.
-Just over 1/3 of the mentorship eligible employees are Senior Engineers.

# Summary

-With over forty thousand retirement eligible employees, management should expect to fill a small portion of these roles throughout the first year. As these employees are in the retirement range longer, the likelihood of their retirement increases. Ultimiately all forty thousand must be filled, but not all at once, based on historical federal data. *ref

-With only ~1500 employees eligible to enter the mentorship program, there are more than enough retirement-ready employees availbale to mentor. A bigger concern would be increasing the number of eligible employees. My recommendation is to start with widening the criteria for eligibility. 

-A query that changes the parameters of eligibility for the mentorship program.
-A table that visualizes the incredible number of retiring Senior Engineers compared to mentorship eligible Engineers.
